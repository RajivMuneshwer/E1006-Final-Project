The app.py file has the main flask files that run the local web server

It has the functions for page one, two and three

Inside of the templates folder are the HTML templates for page1 called index.html

Page2 is secPage.html and the third page is thirdPage.html

The static folder just has a static picture of me (the author)

The final file is a Sudoku file. The original plan was to implement a randomly generated Sudoku puzzle game. I worked on it for quite a bit and tried not to get any help from the internet. But I bit off more than I could chew and so I ran out of time before I found a way to implement it on the web server to be fully interactive.
Nevertheless, I included it because by God am I proud of my crappy little Sudoku player.
